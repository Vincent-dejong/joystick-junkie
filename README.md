# Joystick Junkie

For the real joystick junkies who need the latest information on their favorite games.

## Improvements

Things I would improve upon if this project were to be continued:
- Better error handling from the API, mapping exceptions to failures and passing them back to the UI using functional programming packages like Dartz.
- Better navigation solution, something like go_router.
- More time for UI/UX, with attention to responsive design serving different screen sizes in a better way.
- More extensive code coverage in the tests and widget testing.
- Localization for multiple languages.
- Improved theming with layout system for dimensions (no more repeated padding and margin values).
